/**
 `FilledBubble` is a kind of `Bubble` which is stationary. It has a specific
 position (identified by its row & column number). It is filled into a certain
 cell of a `Level`.
 
 Notice: There is no constraint to the row/column number here. The
 constraints will be enforced in `Level` only. This is because `Bubble`
 is a generic class and even may not be part of the current `Level` object.
