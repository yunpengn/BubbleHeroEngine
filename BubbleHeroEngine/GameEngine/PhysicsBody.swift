/**
 `PhysicsBody` defines some basic physical properties that objects managed by
 the physics engine should minimally satisfy:

 1. The object is modelled as a perfect circle. Thus, all `PhysicsBody`s have
 the same shape.
 2. Each object has its own independent position, velocity and acceleration.
 The position is referred as the center of the circle.
 3. The object does not have a mass or volumn because it is a 2D idealized object.
 4. The object can optionally be collidable. Collision can only happen between
 two collidable bodies.
 5. In this imaginary world, `PhysicsBody` is sticky, i.e., it can be "attached"
 to other `PhysicsBody`s. Notice that "attachment" should be double-way for it to
 make sense, i.e, A is attached to B implies B is attached to A.
 6. Each `PhysicsBody` should be associated with a `UIView` object for the rendering
 engine to use.
