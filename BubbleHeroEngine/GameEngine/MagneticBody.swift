 `MagneticBody` is a special kind of `PhysicsBody` that obeys a (simplified form
 of) Coulomb's law. Due to Coulomb force, there exists a varying attraction between
 a `MagneticBody` and a non-static `PhysicsBody`, whose magnitude is dependent on
 the distance between them.

 In addition, we implement a `canAttract` propert whose default value is true. In
 certain situations, a magnetic body may lose its magnetism temporarily. This is to
 simulate the following real-world physics: For each material of magnet, there is a
 Curie temperature, or temperature at which the heat will destroy the polarization
 of the material, causing it to loses its magnetic properties.
