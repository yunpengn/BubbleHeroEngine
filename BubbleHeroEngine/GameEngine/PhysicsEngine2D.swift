 This class implements a simplified 2D physics engine which supports simple object
 movement, collision detection and attraction (according to Coulomb's law).

 ## Object movement:
 Any object can start moving by giving it an initial speed or giving it an initial
 acceleration. Notice that since `PhysicsBody` does not have a mass, it will not obey
 Newton's 2nd law and thus all acceleration must be explicitly given rather than derived
 from an external force.

 Notice that since we are in the 2D world, gravitational field is not taken into
 consideration. However, the gavitational force can be modelled by manually giving the
 object an acceleration equal to the gravitational constant. Also, the direction of the
 gravity here is not naturally "downwards" as well.

 ## Collision detection:
 Since we only consider the 2D world, all objects only has size, but not volume. Also,
 all objects are modelled as a perfect circle. Thus, we can simply compare the distance
 between the centers of two objects with the sum of their radii to check whether any
 collision occurs between them.

 In addition, collision can only happen between two collidable bodies. This concept is
 inspired by Unity3d game engine.

 ## Attraction:
 Any `MagneticPhysicsBody` can attract other objects. Due to the natural of the application,
 the calculation here is a bit different from the actual physics. A `MagnetricPhysicsBody`
 will actually move every moving object by a varying distance.
